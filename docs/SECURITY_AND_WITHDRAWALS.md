# Security Features & Withdrawal Mechanisms

## üîê Security Verification Feature

### Overview
We've implemented a secret hash verification system that ensures only authorized frontend applications can interact with the smart contract.

### How It Works
1. **Secret Configuration**: A secret string is set in environment variables
2. **Hash Generation**: The secret is hashed using keccak256 and stored in the contract
3. **Frontend Verification**: Every payment transaction must include the original secret
4. **Contract Validation**: The contract verifies the secret matches the stored hash

### Implementation Details

#### Environment Configuration
```env
# Set your secure secret (keep this private!)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_SECRET=your_ultra_secure_secret_here
```

#### Smart Contract
```solidity
// Security verification
bytes32 public secretHash;

constructor(address _feeRecipient, bytes32 _secretHash) {
    require(_feeRecipient != address(0), "Invalid fee recipient");
    require(_secretHash != bytes32(0), "Invalid secret hash");
    feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    secretHash = _secretHash;
}

function processOrderPayment(..., string memory secret) external payable {
    // Verify secret for frontend-contract security
    require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(secret)) == secretHash, "Invalid secret");
    // ... rest of payment logic
}
```

#### Frontend Integration
```typescript
import { PAYMENT_SECURITY } from '@/constants';

// The secret is automatically included in payment transactions
await writeContract({
    address: CELO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    abi: VUNALET_PAYMENTS_ABI,
    functionName: 'processOrderPayment',
    args: [
        orderId,
        farmerAddress,
        dispatcherAddress,
        farmerAmount,
        dispatcherAmount,
        PAYMENT_SECURITY.SECRET  // Secret verification
    ],
    value: totalAmount,
});
```

### Security Benefits
- **Frontend Authentication**: Prevents unauthorized applications from using the contract
- **Access Control**: Ensures only the legitimate Vunalet frontend can process payments
- **Attack Prevention**: Provides protection against unauthorized contract interactions
- **Administrative Control**: Secret can be updated by contract owner when needed

## üí∞ Comprehensive Withdrawal System

### Overview
Our smart contract includes multiple withdrawal mechanisms to ensure funds are never locked and provide flexibility for different scenarios.

### Withdrawal Methods

#### 1. Partial Withdrawal
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance");
    payable(owner()).transfer(amount);
}
```

**Use Case**: Withdraw specific amounts for operational expenses or profit distribution.

#### 2. Withdrawal to Specific Address
```solidity
function withdrawTo(address payable to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance");
    to.transfer(amount);
}
```

**Use Case**: Send funds directly to different addresses (e.g., treasury, team wallets, etc.).

#### 3. Emergency Withdrawal
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw() external onlyOwner {
    payable(owner()).transfer(address(this).balance);
}
```

**Use Case**: Emergency situations where all funds need to be withdrawn immediately.

### Access Control
- **Owner Only**: All withdrawal functions are restricted to the contract owner
- **Address Validation**: Prevents sending funds to invalid addresses
- **Balance Checks**: Ensures sufficient funds before withdrawal
- **Amount Validation**: Prevents zero-amount transactions

### Usage Examples

#### Using Hardhat Console
```javascript
// Connect to deployed contract
const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("VunaletPayments", contractAddress);

// Check contract balance
const balance = await contract.getContractBalance();
console.log("Contract balance:", ethers.utils.formatEther(balance));

// Withdraw 1 CELO
await contract.withdraw(ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"));

// Withdraw to specific address
await contract.withdrawTo(
    "0x742d35cc6435C4532D5c4d0C0e2f1234567890ab",
    ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5")
);

// Emergency withdrawal (all funds)
await contract.emergencyWithdraw();
```

#### Frontend Integration (Admin Panel)
```typescript
// Admin component for contract management
const AdminWithdrawal = () => {
    const { writeContract } = useWriteContract();

    const withdrawFunds = async (amount: string) => {
        await writeContract({
            address: CELO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
            abi: VUNALET_PAYMENTS_ABI,
            functionName: 'withdraw',
            args: [parseEther(amount)]
        });
    };

    // ... UI implementation
};
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### 1. Secret Management
- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- **Use different secrets** for different environments
- **Rotate secrets regularly** using `setSecretHash()`
- **Monitor for unauthorized access** attempts

### 2. Withdrawal Security
- **Multi-signature wallets** recommended for owner account
- **Regular balance monitoring** to detect anomalies
- **Staged withdrawals** instead of large amounts
- **Audit trails** for all withdrawal transactions

### 3. Contract Administration
- **Owner key security** is critical (consider multi-sig)
- **Regular security audits** of contract interactions
- **Monitor contract events** for unusual activity
- **Keep emergency procedures** documented

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Secret is Compromised
1. **Immediately pause** the contract: `contract.pause()`
2. **Update the secret hash**: `contract.setSecretHash(newSecretHash)`
3. **Update frontend environment** variables
4. **Unpause the contract**: `contract.unpause()`
5. **Monitor for suspicious activity**

### If Owner Key is Compromised
1. **Emergency withdraw all funds** to secure address
2. **Deploy new contract** with new owner
3. **Update frontend configuration**
4. **Notify users** of the migration

### If Contract Needs Upgrade
1. **Pause the contract** to prevent new payments
2. **Withdraw all funds** to secure address
3. **Deploy new contract version**
4. **Update frontend configuration**
5. **Resume operations** with new contract

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Contract Events to Monitor
- `PaymentProcessed`: Track payment volume and frequency
- `PaymentDistributed`: Monitor fund distribution
- `PlatformFeeUpdated`: Track fee changes
- `FeeRecipientUpdated`: Monitor admin changes

### Security Metrics
- **Failed secret verification attempts**
- **Unusual payment patterns**
- **Large withdrawal transactions**
- **Admin function usage frequency**

### Recommended Monitoring Tools
- **Celoscan**: For transaction monitoring
- **The Graph**: For event indexing
- **Custom dashboards**: For business metrics
- **Alert systems**: For security events

## üîÑ Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Tasks
- **Monitor contract balance** and withdrawal needs
- **Review payment statistics** for optimization
- **Update conversion rates** as needed
- **Rotate secrets** periodically

### Upgrade Procedures
- **Test all changes** on Alfajores testnet first
- **Coordinate with frontend team** for deployments
- **Maintain backward compatibility** where possible
- **Document all changes** for audit purposes

Key features of this system:
- **Fund Accessibility**: Multiple withdrawal methods ensure funds are never locked
- **Access Control**: Only authorized frontends can interact with the contract
- **Operational Flexibility**: Various withdrawal options for different scenarios
- **Emergency Management**: Procedures in place for crisis situations
- **Security Monitoring**: Tools and metrics to detect and prevent issues
